"""Generate the committed goldens from the UnityPy oracle (R12).

Goldens must never come from this library's own output, so everything written
here is read back out of UnityPy. Run it once after adding or regenerating a
fixture; the oracle is not a dependency of the package or of CI.

Per fixture (keyed by its path under fixtures/bundles/):
  files       - node path -> sha256 of the unpacked bytes  (what M1's env.files must match)
  objects     - per unpacked SerializedFile, the object table
  serialized  - per unpacked SerializedFile: header, externals, type trees, and
                read_typetree() dumps of the DUMPED_CLASSES objects  (M2);
                plus, for a file holding a Texture2D, `textures`: the sha256 of
                its image data and of UnityPy's RGBA decode, rows as stored  (#31);
                for a file holding an AudioClip, Font, VideoClip or
                MovieTexture, `rawData`: the sha256 of the bytes each carries,
                inline or read out of its resource file  (#41); and for a file
                holding a Sprite, `sprites`: UnityPy's sprite image, rows as
                stored, cropped only and with its mesh  (#34); and for every
                file, `names`: each object's `peek_name()`  (#183)
  container   - for a fixture holding SerializedFiles: UnityPy's `env.container`,
                every AssetBundle's m_Container entry in order, as the path and
                the object it resolves to  (#183)
Plus `synthetic`: UnityPy's RGBA for generated block data in the formats no
editor on hand writes (ATC, signed EAC - #32); `platform`: the same for the
console layouts no editor on hand builds (Switch swizzle, Xbox 360 byte swap),
in both row orders; and `deswizzle`: UnityPy's Switch deswizzle alone (#33).

Normalization (plan section 5), applied by walking the type tree next to the
value so the node type decides, not the Python type:
  SInt64/UInt64/FileSize -> decimal string
  float  -> "f32:<8 hex digits>"   double -> "f64:<16 hex digits>"  (bit patterns,
            big-endian, so NaN / -0 / Infinity compare exactly)
  TypelessData, vectors of UInt8/SInt8/char, other raw bytes -> "hex:<hex>"
  hashes (guid, script ids) -> hex string

# UnityPy's Pillow parts ways with upstream Texture2DDecoder (texture2ddecoder-wasm
# 1.2.2's, and AssetStudio's and K0lb3's, which agree with it). Verdicts (#131):
#   DXT1 index 3: AssetStudio, opaque black. Pillow gives transparent black,
#     but Unity's DXT1 has no alpha.
#   DXT5 colour: Pillow is right. The spec decodes it as though c0 > c1
#     always, and Texture2DDecoder's 3-colour mode is a defect, fixed in
#     the decoder by #137 (texture2ddecoder-wasm 1.2.3), which the
#     texture package depends on. So the DXT5 inputs are the random bytes
#     unmodified, c0 <= c1 blocks included (#147).
# The fixtures' DXT data has no such block (#32), random bytes do. So the DXT1
# inputs get every colour block's c0 > c1, by setting the top bit of c0's high
# byte and clearing c1's (`four_color`, mirrored by `fourColor` in the texture
# tests): each entry is (block stride, index of c0's high byte, index of c1's),
