# Plan: browser-first Unity AssetBundle reader (TS + WASM leaf codecs)

Working name: `unity-asset-reader`. Monorepo (npm workspaces): a shared parser core plus feature packages; the texture decoder, `texture2ddecoder-wasm`, is one of the packages (D7, D8). Every package versions on its own and is released when its version changes (2026-09-28c). License: MIT, except `unity-asset-reader-texture`, which is `MIT AND Apache-2.0` (see the 2026-09-27b and 2026-10-06 revisions). Source of truth for behavior: Razviar/assetstudio (MIT). Secondary reference + golden oracle: UnityPy (MIT).

Checkable rules derived from this plan: [unity-asset-reader-rules.md](unity-asset-reader-rules.md). Workflows: `.claude/skills/{implement-issue,review-implementation,fix-pr-comments}`.

## 0. Locked decisions

| # | Decision | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| D1 | **Port from AssetStudio (MIT). Do not fork, copy from, or import `@arkntools/unity-js` anywhere — including tests.** | unity-js is **AGPL-3.0**. A fork forces AGPL on the package and on every web app that ships it. AssetStudio, UnityPy and all chosen deps are MIT. This is a derivative port, not clean-room: keep Perfare / RazTools / Razviar (and UnityPy, where consulted) copyright notices in `LICENSE`/`NOTICE`. Two exceptions to MIT-only sources, both in the texture package and shipped with attribution and `LICENSE-APACHE`: the sprite tight-mesh fill is derived from ImageSharp.Drawing (Apache-2.0, #34), and the variant-atlas bicubic resize from ImageSharp 2.1.3 (Apache-2.0, #153). |
| D2 | TS parser, WASM only for leaf **C/C++** codecs. **No C# is ever compiled to WASM** (no Blazor / .NET-wasm / NativeAOT-LLVM / IL2CPP output). AssetStudio C# is a read-only behavior reference, hand-ported to TS. | Parsing is byte shuffling; WASM boundary = copies, no gain. A .NET runtime in WASM = multi-MB download + own GC, kills CDN drop-in. WASM inputs allowed: `texture2ddecoder` (C++), fallback `LzmaDec.c` (C), M6 `acl` (C++), `libvorbis` (C), `spirv-cross` (C++). |
| D3 | Core is isomorphic: zero `node:*`, zero DOM. Input = `Uint8Array`; `open()` gets it from a URL, `Request`, `Response` or `Blob` with the WHATWG `fetch` / `Response` / `Blob` / `URL` globals only, which Node has too (2026-09-28b). | "Works in browser same as the texture decoder". |
| D4 | Core **parsing is sync; `open()` (loading input) and texture decoding are async.** Async is `open()` (fetching / reading the bytes, then a sync `load()`), `initialize()` / `initTexture()` and texture decode; nothing that parses returns a promise (2026-09-28b). | Matches existing lib; avoids async colouring the whole reader. Consequence: big bundles block the calling thread — docs and `examples/cdn.html` run the reader in a **Worker**. |
| D5 | No image encoding in core. Output `{ data: Uint8Array /*RGBA*/, width, height }`. | Kills Jimp/ImageSharp class of deps. Browser → `ImageData`; Node → caller's choice. |
| D6 | Single-threaded WASM only. No pthreads/SharedArrayBuffer. | pthreads force COOP/COEP headers → breaks drop-in CDN use. |
| D7 | **Several npm packages around one shared core.** `unity-asset-reader` (dir `packages/core`) is the isomorphic parser and the only place parsing lives. Feature packages depend on it and never on each other's internals: `unity-asset-reader-texture` (`packages/texture`), `unity-asset-reader-node` (`packages/node`), M6 items each get their own (`-mesh`, `-audio`, ...). `texture2ddecoder-wasm` (`packages/decoder`) is a standalone leaf: it depends on nothing in the repo and keeps its npm name, API and 1.x version line (see the 2026-09-28a revision). **Every package versions independently** (2026-09-28c): `unity-asset-reader`, `-texture`, `-node` and `texture2ddecoder-wasm` each have their own version, starting at 1.0.0 for the readers, and each is released only when its own version changes. The ranges between packages say which versions go together: a feature package's peer `^<major>` on core, the texture package's `^` on the decoder. | A user who only unpacks bundles does not install WASM; a user who only decodes textures keeps using `texture2ddecoder-wasm` alone. Heavy M6 codecs (ACL, vorbis, spirv-cross) never bloat the core. Separate packages also make the decoder a normal `dependency` of the texture package instead of an optional-peer workaround. The decoder has nothing Unity-specific in it (it is Texture2DDecoder built to WASM), and its published name is what people search for; the texture package's `^` range on it says which decoder goes with which reader. Names are final at first publish (#45); if an npm org is available, `@unity-asset-reader/{core,texture,node}` is the alternative. |
| D8 | **One git repo, npm workspaces, everything under `packages/`; repo is `unity-asset-reader`.** Root `package.json` is `private`, `"workspaces": ["packages/*"]`, and holds only shared dev tooling and scripts. The existing decoder package **moved** from repo root to `packages/` together with its submodule, `wasm_bindings.cpp`, `scripts/`, `examples/`, tests and README (#55); its folder is `packages/decoder` since #174 and publishes as `texture2ddecoder-wasm` (folder names are internal; `packages/core` publishes as `unity-asset-reader`). Plain npm workspaces only: no lerna / nx / turbo / changesets. **A release is a merged version bump** (2026-09-28c): `.github/workflows/release.yml` publishes each package whose `package.json` `version` changed on `main` and is not on npm yet, in dependency order; a pull request gets the same plan as a dry run. | Issues, CI and scaffolding already here. Workspaces link the packages in dev (no `file:..`), give one lockfile and one `npm ci`. The move is mechanical but touches the submodule path, `build-wasm.sh` paths and the npm publish dir, so it is its own M0 issue with a hard check: `npm pack --dry-run` file list of the decoder identical before and after (the #174 rename and its #182 revert kept that check). `docs/` stays at repo root (GitHub Pages serves from it). GitHub redirects old repo URLs after rename; update `repository.url` (and add `repository.directory`) in every `package.json` then. |
| D9 | 64-bit integers: **always `bigint`** for SInt64/UInt64 typetree fields and pathIDs. File offsets/sizes stay `number` with a `> 2^53` guard throw. | Typetrees carry int64 everywhere (every PPtr). "number when safe" gives a value whose type depends on its magnitude. Ship a documented JSON replacer (`bigint → string`). |

## 1. Dependencies (all MIT, all browser-safe, all sync)

Runtime deps of `packages/core` unless the note names another package. Between workspace packages: feature packages list `unity-asset-reader` as a `peerDependency` (one core instance per app, so `instanceof` and `ClassID` stay shared) plus a `devDependency` for the workspace link.

| Need | Dep | Note |
|---|---|---|
| Block texture decode + Crunch | `texture2ddecoder-wasm` (workspace package) | regular `dependency` of `unity-asset-reader-texture` only; core never imports it. Outputs **BGRA** → swap to RGBA (M3). |
| LZ4 / LZ4HC block | none — ~40 LOC in `packages/core/src/codec/lz4.ts` | port `AssetStudio/LZ4/LZ4.cs`. LZ4HC decodes identically; no separate path or fixture. |
| LZMA | `lzma1` (pure TS) — **decided**, see M1 spike #13 | Two stream shapes, see M1. Correct on both; ~10 MB/s, under the original 20 MB/s bar. Kept anyway: it is sync, zero-dep and browser-safe, so core stays WASM-free. WASM fallback deferred to M6 (#69), to be built only if real bundles make this hurt. |
| gzip/zlib | `fflate` | 8KB, sync (native `DecompressionStream` is async → violates D4) |
| LZHAM, brotli | — | skipped; throw `UnsupportedError` |
| zstd (M6 only) | `fzstd` | **not stock Unity** — only game-specific forks emit it. Lands with game variants (#50). |
| AES (M6 only) | `aes-js` | WebCrypto is async + no ECB |

## 2. Layout

What belongs in core: anything two packages need, and anything that reads Unity bytes into fields (so `classes/Texture2D.ts` and `classes/Sprite.ts` live in core; turning their bytes into pixels lives in `texture`). What does not: WASM, pixel conversion, `fs`, anything with a heavy or optional dependency. The decoder shares no code with core today; if a second WASM package appears (LZMA fallback, M6 — #69), its emscripten loader is extracted then, not before.

Every reader package builds ESM + CJS + types through `rollup.reader.mjs`. `core` and `texture` use `resolve({ browser: true })` with **no** node builtins in `external`; only `node` may externalize them.

**Externalization rule (#71, decided):** *everything a package declares in `dependencies`, `peerDependencies` or `optionalDependencies` is `external`; everything else is bundled, except the node builtins `packages/node` passes through `external` itself.* One rule for workspace siblings and npm deps alike — `rollup.reader.mjs` reads the package's own manifest, so adding a dep to `package.json` is the only step. `dist/` keeps the bare `import`, npm resolves it at install time. Consequences, accepted:

- A dep is never both inlined in `dist/` and installed beside it. No second copy, and a security fix in a decompressor that eats untrusted bytes (`fflate`, `lzma1` — #14, #15) reaches consumers through `npm update`, not through a republish of this package.
- No per-dep NOTICE obligation: we distribute no copy of their code. The `fflate` stanza added by #68 is dropped.
- Consumers dedupe and tree-shake the dep themselves.
- A bare specifier in `dist/` means CDN use needs an import map or a CDN ESM endpoint (`/+esm`, esm.sh) — still zero bundler, so M3's `examples/cdn.html` criterion stands. `unity-asset-reader-texture` needs one regardless, since `texture2ddecoder-wasm` is external either way; this makes it one pattern to document instead of two. A separate bundled `dist/*.bundle.mjs` CDN build was rejected: it doubles the published output and keeps the NOTICE chore it was meant to avoid. Revisit only if a real CDN consumer cannot use an import map.
- An undeclared import is **not** caught by the build: npm hoists root devDependencies and symlinks workspace siblings into the root `node_modules`, so rollup resolves them and inlines them silently. Only a package absent from `node_modules` fails (`UNRESOLVED_IMPORT`). The guard is a test — `scripts/tests/rollup-reader.test.mjs` fails `npm run verify` when a reader package's `src/` imports something its `package.json` does not declare — with `check:browser` covering the R14 half at source level.

## 3. Public API (target)

```ts
import { load } from 'unity-asset-reader'
import { initTexture, decodeTexture2D } from 'unity-asset-reader-texture'

await initTexture({ wasmPath: '/wasm' })                // once; passthrough to texture2ddecoder-wasm

const env = load([{ name: 'a.bundle', data: u8 }, { name: 'a.resS', data: u8b }])
for (const obj of env.objects) {
  if (obj.type === ClassID.Texture2D) {
    const { data, width, height } = await decodeTexture2D(obj.read())   // RGBA
  }
}
env.files        // unpacked CAB / resS entries: { path, data }  ← pure "unpack" use case
obj.readTypeTree()  // generic JS object for any class with an embedded typetree; int64 → bigint (D9)
```

That is the low-level API, and it stays as it is: `env.objects`, `ObjectReader.read()`, `readTypeTree()`, `env.resolve()`, `env.readResource()` and the `read*` class readers.

### High-level API (2026-09-28b)

A TypeScript-style layer over the same `Env`, for callers who want assets rather than objects. It does not mirror UnityPy's interface.

```ts
import { load, open } from 'unity-asset-reader'

const env = load(bytes)                                   // Uint8Array | ArrayBuffer; name optional
const env2 = load([bundleBytes, { name: 'sharedassets0.assets.resS', data: resS }])
const env3 = await open('https://cdn.example.com/ui.bundle') // URL | string | Request | Response | Blob/File | bytes | { name, data } | array

for (const asset of env.assets()) {            // every object, in env.objects order
  asset.type      // 'Texture2D' | 'Sprite' | ... (classes with a hand reader) | 'Other'
  asset.typeName  // class name for every class ('Mesh' when type is 'Other')
  asset.classId; asset.pathId; asset.file; asset.byteSize
  asset.name      // m_Name, '' when the class has none; reads only as far as m_Name
  asset.path      // first m_Container path pointing at it, or undefined
  asset.data      // obj.read() with camelCase names (#184), on first access, cached; narrowed by `switch (asset.type)`
}
env.assets('Texture2D', 'Sprite')              // filtered and narrowed
env.get('Assets/UI/Icon.png')                  // by container path, case-insensitive, or undefined
```

- **Data plus free functions, no per-class methods.** An `Asset` is plain data with a discriminant (`type`); its `data` is what `obj.read()` returns, as plain data with camelCase field names without `m_` (#184; `obj.read()` keeps Unity's). Whatever an asset can be turned into is a free function taking it (#185: texture `isImage` / `decodeImage`), never a method on an asset class.
- `type` is the class name for the classes with a hand reader and `'Other'` for the rest (a `string` fallback would stop `switch` from narrowing `data`); `typeName` names every class.
- `load()` takes one input or an array; an input is bytes or `{ name?, data }`, a missing name becomes `input <index>`. Loose files still need their real names (resource and externals lookup).
- `open()` is the async way in: it only gets the bytes (global `fetch` or `options.fetch`, `Blob.arrayBuffer()`), names each file after its URL's last path segment or `File.name`, throws on a non-OK response, then calls `load()`. Parsing stays sync (D4).
- #184 gives `data` TypeScript-style field names; #185 adds the texture functions on top of `Asset`.

## 4. Milestones

Each milestone = shippable npm prerelease. "Port" lists the AssetStudio files that define behavior.

### M0 — Monorepo skeleton + browser guard (1 d)
- **First: convert the repo to npm workspaces and move the existing package** to `packages/` (D8; `packages/decoder` since #174): `git mv` incl. the submodule, fix `build-wasm.sh` / `copy-wasm.js` paths, private root `package.json`. No source or API change. Check: `npm pack --dry-run` file list identical before/after; its `build:rollup` and tests still pass.
- Scaffold `packages/core`, `packages/texture`, `packages/node` (§2) on `tsconfig.base.json` + `rollup.reader.mjs`; empty modules, one smoke test each.
- Root scripts: `build` (all TS builds, no Docker), `test` (reader packages; the decoder's tests join only when its `wasm/` output exists, since that needs Docker), `check:browser`, and `verify` = all of them + the no-C# guard. One command for humans, agents and CI.
- CI: one workflow running `npm ci && npm run verify` at the root.
- CI guard (D2): `git ls-files '*.cs' '*.csproj' '*.sln'` must be empty — no C# in the repo, so none can reach a WASM build.
- CI guard: `esbuild --bundle --platform=browser` on the `core` and `texture` entries must succeed with **no** node-builtin resolution (the decoder marked external). This is the whole browser-safety test; cheap and catches every regression.
- Done when: `npm ci && npm run verify` is green at the root; every reader package emits `dist/index.{mjs,cjs,d.ts}`; decoder tarball unchanged by the move.

### M1 — Unpack (layers 1–2) (3–4 d)
- **First task: golden harness (#20).** Every later "Done when" depends on it. See §5.
- All of M1 and M2 lands in `packages/core`.
- Port: `EndianBinaryReader.cs`, `FileReader.cs` (detection only), `BundleFile.cs` (UnityFS, UnityWeb, UnityRaw; flags, blocksInfo at end, v7 alignment, 2019.4+ padding), `WebFile.cs`, `LZ4.cs`.
- `UnityArchive` signature: detect, throw `UnsupportedError`. Upstream has no implementation to port (confirm in `BundleFile.cs` while porting).
- Compression types: none, LZMA, LZ4, LZ4HC. LZHAM and anything else → `UnsupportedError(type)`.
- LZMA (spike #13, **done**) covers **both** stream shapes:
  - UnityFS block: 5 prop bytes + raw data, uncompressed size from block info → synthesize the 13-byte `.lzma` header.
  - Legacy UnityWeb/UnityRaw: 5 prop bytes + u64 size already in the stream.
  - **Outcome: `lzma1`.** Correct on both shapes (sha256-exact against the #20 goldens), sync, `Uint8Array` in/out, no node builtins. Measured ~10 MB/s on a 50 MB block in both Node 22 and Chromium, against a native-liblzma reference of 44.5 MB/s.
  - The original bar was ≥ 20 MB/s on a single ~50 MB block, with `LzmaDec.c` as the fallback. **The bar is retired, not met.** Taking the WASM path would put WASM in core, which §2 and AGENTS.md forbid, and D4's consequence already routes big bundles through a Worker — so ~5 s on a 50 MB block instead of ~2.5 s does not justify it yet. Revisit via #69 if real bundle sizes make it hurt.
  - `lzma1` does **not** throw on truncated input — it returned 52 MB of garbage for a 100 KB slice of a 26 MB stream. #14's wrapper must assert the output length itself (R9).
- gzip-wrapped files via `fflate`.
- `BinaryReader` directly over `Uint8Array`. No `ByteSource` interface yet — one impl, one backlog consumer (#51). Guard: total uncompressed block size above typed-array limit → throw.
- Done when: `load()` returns `env.files` byte-identical to golden raw-file hashes for fixtures covering: LZ4, LZMA (UnityFS), LZMA (legacy UnityWeb), uncompressed, gzip-wrapped.

### M2 — SerializedFile + TypeTree (5–6 d)
- Port: `SerializedFile.cs`, `SerializedFileHeader/FormatVersion`, `SerializedType.cs`, `TypeTree*.cs`, `TypeTreeHelper.cs`, `CommonString.cs`, `ClassIDType.cs`, `ObjectInfo.cs`, `ObjectReader.cs`, `PPtr.cs`; include the fork's Unity 6000 typetree fixes (`UNITY_6000_FIXES.md`).
- Generic `readTypeTree()` → plain JS object. This alone decodes *every* class in bundles with embedded typetrees — biggest capability per LOC in the project.
- Format-version claim: parse code is **ported for all versions upstream handles; tested only on what fixtures cover** (Editors 2019.4 / 2020.3 / 6000 = formats 21 and 22, both required by the fixture tests; #82). README states the tested range. Older versions get a fixture when someone installs a 5.x/2017/2018 editor — not before.
- Done when: object table (pathID, classID, size) matches goldens for every fixture incl. one Unity 6 bundle; typetree dump equals golden for TextAsset/MonoBehaviour under the §5 normalization.

### M3 — Textures + sprites (4–5 d)
- Split: class readers (`Texture2D`, `Texture`, `StreamingInfo`, `Sprite`, `SpriteAtlas`) and the resource resolver go to `packages/core`; everything that produces pixels goes to `packages/texture`.
- Port: `Classes/Texture2D.cs`, `Texture.cs`, `StreamingInfo` + `ResourceReader.cs` (→ `env.ts`), `Texture2DConverter.cs` (plain formats in TS: Alpha8, RGB24, RGBA32, ARGB32, BGRA32, RGB565, ARGB/RGBA4444, R16, R/RG/RGBA Half+Float, RGB9e5, YUY2; block + Crunch → `texture2ddecoder-wasm`), platform swaps (Switch/XBOX360 byte-swap), vertical flip.
- **Channel order:** the decoder and AssetStudio's converter both produce BGRA. Public output is RGBA (D5) → one in-place R/B swap after block decode (#32); plain-format converters write RGBA directly. Goldens are hashed post-swap.
- **TextureFormat ids** follow Unity's own numbering (UnityCsReference `GraphicsEnums.cs`), not the Razviar fork's shifted `R16_Alt = 66`; decided on PR #113, recorded on #28.
- Then: `Sprite.cs`, `SpriteAtlas.cs`, `SpriteHelper.cs` (crop, rotate/flip packing; tight-mesh mask = optional flag, polygon fill in TS).
- Done when: RGBA output hash-equal to golden pixels for one fixture per format family; `examples/cdn.html` renders a texture from a bundle with zero bundler, reader running in a Worker, proven against this repo's builds behind a local `/+esm` stand-in. The live jsDelivr path needs the 1.0 publish and is checked in M5 (#150).

### M4 — Hardcoded classes for typetree-stripped bundles (2–3 d)
- All in `packages/core`.
- Port minimal readers: `Object`, `EditorExtension`, `NamedObject`, `AssetBundle` (container map), `TextAsset`, `MonoScript`, `MonoBehaviour` (header only), `Material`, `AudioClip` (metadata + raw FSB bytes out), `Font` (raw ttf/otf out), `VideoClip`/`MovieTexture` (raw out).
- Raw-bytes-out covers audio/font/video "extract" without any decoder.
- Done when: container paths + names match golden asset list for a stripped-typetree fixture.

### M5 — node adapter package + 1.0 (1–2 d)
- `packages/node`: `loadPath(fileOrDir)`: fs read, dir scan, split-file (`.split0..n`) merge, sidecar `.resS/.resource` lookup. Port only that slice of `AssetsManager.cs` / `ImportHelper.cs`.
- README (incl. tested format-version range, Worker guidance, bigint JSON replacer), QUICK_START, bundler guide (reuse existing lib's docs structure). Root README becomes the package index. First publish: `texture2ddecoder-wasm` 1.2.3 (it carries #137 and #149, which the texture package and its goldens rely on), then 1.0.0 of `unity-asset-reader`, `-texture` and `-node`, through the release workflow's manual dispatch, which publishes every version not on npm yet in dependency order (#192). From then on each package is released on its own, by merging a change of its `version` (2026-09-28c).

### M6+ — On demand, each independent
Each item that brings a decoder or writer ships as its own package on top of core (D7); only the class field readers it needs are added to core.
| Item | Work | Trigger |
|---|---|---|
| Mesh → glTF | `Mesh.cs` (1.5k LOC, vertex decompression) + glTF writer in TS | need 3D |
| AudioClip → WAV/OGG | FSB5 parser TS + vorbis header rebuild; wasm libvorbis own repo | need playable audio |
| AnimationClip + `acl-wasm` | `AnimationClip.cs` 2k LOC + emscripten ACL | need animation |
| Game variants: zstd, UnityCN / game crypto | `fzstd`; `Crypto/*`, `aes-js`; plugin hook in `BundleFile` block read. Fixtures are third-party by nature → kept out of repo. | specific game |
| Blob-backed reads for big `.resS` | introduce `ByteSource` seam (`read(offset,len)`, `size`) here; `FileReaderSync` in a Worker keeps it **sync** — no async variant | OOM on big `.resS` |
| Shader | smol-v TS + spirv-cross wasm | unlikely |

## 5. Testing

- Runner: `tsx --test` (same as existing lib), tests in `packages/<pkg>/tests/`; fixtures and goldens shared from root `fixtures/`.
- **Golden oracle: UnityPy** (`pip install UnityPy`; MIT, cross-platform, scriptable). One script `scripts/make-goldens.py` emits per fixture: raw file hashes (`env.files`), object table, typetree JSON (`read_typetree()`), RGBA hashes. AssetStudio CLI is a Windows `.exe` with an unverified raw-dump path — use it only to cross-check disagreements, not in the harness.
- Goldens generated **once**, committed. The oracle is not a dependency of the package or CI.
- Typetree comparison normalization (both sides): int64 → decimal string; floats compared by float32 bit pattern (NaN/-0 safe), not by printed text; byte arrays → hex or hash.
- Fixtures: small bundles per (compression × editor version × texture family), zipped like `samples.zip`, built with own Unity Editor projects.
- Browser: M0 esbuild guard + one Playwright smoke loading `examples/cdn.html` (M3), and one Playwright test of the GitHub Pages demo `docs/index.html` (#209). No per-feature browser suite.

## 6. Risks

| Risk | Mitigation |
|---|---|
| `lzma1` API/perf mismatch | 2h spike at start of M1 with a numeric bar (both stream shapes, ≥ 20 MB/s); fallback is a known recipe |
| Fixture licensing (game assets) | build own fixtures with Unity Editor (2019.4/2020.3/6000; `fixtures/BUILDING.md`); never commit third-party game data. Consequence accepted: old format versions and game variants ship untested-by-fixture. |
| Oracle is wrong / disagrees with AssetStudio | UnityPy and AssetStudio are independent implementations; on mismatch, cross-check with AssetStudio GUI and record the verdict next to the golden |
| 64-bit values | D9: `bigint` for all int64 fields + pathIDs; offsets as `number` with `> 2^53` guard throw |

Revision 2026-09-21c (#71): §2 states the externalization rule for `rollup.reader.mjs` — declared `dependencies`/`peerDependencies` are external, everything else is bundled.

Revision 2026-09-21b (monorepo, D7/D8 rewritten): new M0 issue #55 for the workspaces conversion + package move (#7 → scaffold reader packages, depends on #55; #8 → guards for core/texture + R14; #9 → root `verify` CI); #6–#9 re-scoped to `packages/*` and root `verify`; every implementation issue names its package; #28/#29–#35 split core/texture; #32 decoder is a regular dependency; #43 → `packages/node`; #44/#45 multi-package docs and lockstep publish; M6+ items (#47–#52) each name their own package. Milestones M0/M5 retitled. PR #54 (single-package scaffold) is superseded by the re-scoped #7.

Issue edits applied for the previous revision (2026-09-21, via `gh`):
- #6, #7, #9 → scaffold + CI scoped to `unity-asset-reader/` subdir (D8).
- #8 → adds no-C# guard (D2).
- #10, #21, #28 → epic goals/done-criteria aligned.
- #11 → `BinaryReader` only; `ByteSource` moves to #51.
- #13 → both LZMA stream shapes + 20 MB/s bar.
- #15 → gzip/zlib only; zstd moves to #50.
- #18 → drop UnityArchive (throw unsupported).
- #20 → UnityPy harness + normalization; do first in M1.
- #19, #22, #23, #25, #32, #36 → "match AssetStudio" → "match goldens (#20)".
- #35 → example runs reader in a Worker.
- #6–#52 → footer: "clean-room" → MIT-derivative wording + UnityPy oracle + no-C#→WASM rule.

Revision 2026-09-21c (M1 spike #13 resolved): LZMA is **`lzma1`**, not the `LzmaDec.c` WASM fallback. The spike measured it correct on both stream shapes but at ~10 MB/s against a 20 MB/s bar; the bar is retired rather than met, because the WASM route would put WASM in `packages/core` (forbidden by §2 and the AGENTS.md core row) and D4 already routes big bundles through a Worker. The WASM fallback becomes on-demand M6 work (#69), to be built only on a real complaint or a measured regression on genuine bundles. §1's LZMA row and the M1 LZMA bullet record the outcome; §2's "LZMA fallback, M6" line was already consistent and now names the issue. Also recorded: `lzma1` does not throw on truncated input, so #14's wrapper must assert output length itself (R9).

Revision 2026-09-26 (#81, #82): M2 fixtures are editor-built with 2019.4.41f2 (SerializedFile format 21), 2020.3.30f1 and 6000.3.25f1 (format 22); only the bundles are committed, the Unity project stays local and `fixtures/BUILDING.md` carries its sources (R2). The M2 format-version claim and the §6 licensing row name these editors. Also recorded: UnityPy cannot fully read a v1 `[SerializeReference]` registry (≤ 2020.3), so `make-goldens.py` records an `oracleNote` for that case (#25); `files` goldens hash raw node bytes, not UnityPy's re-serialization (#81).

Revision 2026-09-27 (#35, PR #151): M3's `examples/cdn.html` criterion no longer requires jsDelivr. The reader packages are first published in M5 (#45), so M3 proves the page against this repo's builds behind `examples/serve.mjs`, a local stand-in for jsDelivr's `/+esm`; the live jsDelivr check is #150, in M5.

Revision 2026-09-27b (#34, PR #156): the texture package's optional sprite tight-mesh fill is derived from ImageSharp.Drawing v1.0.0-beta15 (Apache-2.0, Six Labors), kept by maintainer decision because it makes the mask match AssetStudio pixel-for-pixel. `unity-asset-reader-texture` therefore declares `"license": "MIT AND Apache-2.0"` and ships `LICENSE-APACHE` plus a `NOTICE` stanza; the derived code carries a per-file Apache-2.0 header. Core, node and `texture2ddecoder-wasm` stay MIT. D1 notes the exception.

Revision 2026-09-27c (#174, maintainer decision): every package ships under **one version**, and the decoder is renamed so the family starts together at **1.0.0**. `texture2ddecoder-wasm` becomes `unity-asset-reader-decoder` (folder `packages/decoder`) at 1.0.0 with its public API unchanged; only the npm name and version change. The reader packages are 1.0.0 too, and all four are released together from now on. `texture2ddecoder-wasm` stays at 1.2.2 on npm; after the first publish the maintainer deprecates it with a pointer to the new name (not done from the repo). Reverses D7's "keeps its npm name, API and 1.x version line" and "versions independently", D8's `packages/texture2ddecoder-wasm/` path, and R13's "keeps its npm name". D7, D8, §1, §2, M0, M3 and M5 now name the new package.

Revision 2026-09-28b (#183, maintainer decision): the reader gets a TypeScript-style high-level API before 1.0 (§3 "High-level API"): `load()` takes bare bytes and single inputs, `open()` fetches or reads input asynchronously and then calls `load()`, `env.assets()` yields every object as an `Asset` (plain data with a `type` discriminant and a lazy `data`), `env.get(path)` looks assets up by container path. The design is data plus free functions, with no per-class methods; the low-level API stays alongside. D4 and R5 now read "parsing is sync; `open()` (loading input) and texture decoding are async", and D3 / R4 name the WHATWG globals `open()` uses. §2 lists `asset.ts` and `open.ts`.

Revision 2026-09-28a (#182, maintainer decision): reverses the naming and versioning half of 2026-09-27c. The decoder goes back to its published name **`texture2ddecoder-wasm`** and keeps **its own version line**; its next release is 1.2.3 (#137, #149). `unity-asset-reader-decoder` was never published and is dropped; there is no migration and no `npm deprecate`. The three reader packages stay in lockstep and start at 1.0.0; `unity-asset-reader-texture` depends on `texture2ddecoder-wasm@^1.2.3`, so decoder 1.2.3 is published before the readers' 1.0.0. The folder stays `packages/decoder`. Releases use two tag families, `unity-asset-reader@<v>` and `texture2ddecoder-wasm@<v>`, because the decoder's old `v1.x` tags exist. D7, D8, §1, §2, §3, M3, M5 and R13 name `texture2ddecoder-wasm` again.

Revision 2026-09-28c (#192, maintainer decision): **no shared version**. `unity-asset-reader`, `unity-asset-reader-texture`, `unity-asset-reader-node` and `texture2ddecoder-wasm` each version independently; the readers are no longer in lockstep. A release is **a change of `version` in a package's `package.json`**, merged to `main`: the release workflow publishes each package whose version changed and is not on npm yet, in dependency order (decoder, core, texture, node), after checking that each one's ranges on other packages of this repo (`dependencies`, `peerDependencies`) are satisfied on npm or by a package published earlier in the same run. A pull request that changes a `package.json` runs the same plan as a dry run, without environment, secrets or OIDC token; `workflow_dispatch` publishes every version not on npm yet (the first release, recovery). After each publish the workflow pushes a `<name>@<version>` tag as a record; nothing triggers on tags. Replaces the lockstep versioning and the tag-triggered, family-based releases of #175 and 2026-09-28a. Versions are unchanged: readers 1.0.0, decoder 1.2.3. D7, D8, M5 and the rules (R13, Git and PRs) updated.

Revision 2026-10-06 (#153, PR #227, maintainer decision): a second Apache-2.0 exception, handled like #34's. The texture package's variant-atlas resize (`packages/texture/src/resize.ts`) is derived from SixLabors ImageSharp 2.1.3 (Apache-2.0, Six Labors), the version AssetStudio resizes a variant atlas with, kept because it makes the resized sprite match AssetStudio's to the byte. It carries a per-file Apache-2.0 header and a `NOTICE` stanza; `unity-asset-reader-texture` stays `"MIT AND Apache-2.0"` with the same `LICENSE-APACHE`. D1 names both exceptions.
