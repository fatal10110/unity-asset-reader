 *
 * Where TPK and upstream disagree, TPK is followed: `atlasRectOffset` from
 * 5.4.6 and 5.5.3 (upstream: 5.6), `m_IsPolygon` gone in 6000.5, and a
 * `SecondarySpriteTexture.name` that is an aligned string (upstream reads a
 * C string). `m_Pivot` keeps upstream's 5.4.1p3
 * gate, which TPK (no 5.4.1 patch releases) cannot contradict, and
 * `SpriteVertex.pos` upstream's `readVector3`, which reads four floats before
 * 5.4 where TPK has three: no fixture predates 2019.4, and the end-of-object
 * check refuses a wrong guess.
 *
 * ponytail: `SpriteVertex.pos` before 5.4 is read as four floats, as #34's
 * acceptance and upstream require (maintainer decision on PR #156), though
 * TPK records three. If TPK is right, every 4.3 to 5.3 sprite with vertices
 * fails the end-of-object check (a CorruptError) rather than being read. A
 * 5.x fixture settles it (#155).
 *
 * A file whose Unity version is unknown (`[0, 0, 0, 0]`, as
 * `AssetBundleStripUnityVersion` leaves it) is read when its format is 18 to
 * 21: only Unity 2019 writes those, and every 2019 release has one Sprite
 * layout (rule for version-stripped files, #36, as amended; as `readMaterial`
 * does). That layout is assumed, not known, so an object that does not fit it
 * is refused as not that layout rather than called corrupt. Any other format
 * allows layouts that differ inside the object, which the bytes cannot tell
 * apart, so the file is refused.
 *
 * ponytail: the gates compare release numbers only (see `atLeast`), except
 * the two patch-release gates, as upstream's do. Unity changed this layout in
 * pre-releases: 5.6.0b1 to b9 lack `atlasRectOffset`, 2019.1.0a1 to a9 (format
 * 18) lack `secondaryTextures`, and 6000.5.0a3 to a6 lack `m_BlendShapes`; such
 * a pre-release fails the end-of-object check. Compare the build type in the
 * gate if one ever matters.
 *
 * @param reader the object's reader, rewound first and left at its end
 * @throws {UnsupportedError} of kind `"Unity version"`, with the file's own
 *   `unityVersion` as `found`: when the version is unknown (`[0, 0, 0, 0]`:
 *   stripped, or a loose file below format 7) unless the format is 18 to 21,
