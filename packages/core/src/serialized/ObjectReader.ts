   * `classes/registry.ts`, the one list of them, and {@link ObjectData} is the
   * union of what they return; each result type there documents its shape. A
   * reader that needs a resource file (a `Texture2D`'s `.resS` / `.resource`,
   * named by `m_StreamData`) reads it through the env that built this reader.
   *
   * `MonoBehaviour` is the exception: its hardcoded reader reads only the
   * header, so when the file has a type tree `read()` is the whole
   * {@link readTypeTree} result, the script's fields included, and only
   * without one is it the header `readMonoBehaviour` reads.
   *
   * When a hardcoded reader refuses an object, `read()` throws; it does not
   * fall back to the type tree. Call {@link readTypeTree} for that.
   *
   * **`T` is not checked.** It is the caller's claim about the result, an
   * unchecked cast of the `ObjectData` union, and nothing at run time makes it
   * true. Pick it after checking {@link type}, as in
   * `if (obj.type === ClassID.Texture2D) decodeTexture2D(obj.read())`, where
   * it is inferred from the parameter; without it the result is the union.
   * The type system does not stop `decodeTexture2D(obj.read())` on any other
   * class either, so a consumer such as `decodeTexture2D` must validate its
   * input at run time rather than trust the type.
   *
   * @throws {UnsupportedError} of kind `"Unity version"`, with the file's own
   *   `unityVersion` as `found`, when a version-gated class reader has no

   *   below Unity 3.4), or an unknown one (`[0, 0, 0, 0]`: version-stripped, or
   *   a loose file below format 7) unless the file's format and the object's
   *   own bytes leave exactly one candidate layout (the rule on epic #36). So
   *   `Texture2D` and `MonoScript` refuse every version-stripped file, while
   *   `TextAsset` (from format 7) and `AssetBundle` (from format 16) read one
   *   where the bytes decide. An editor file's header of an unknown or pre-3.4
   *   version is refused the same way. Each reader's JSDoc gives its exact
   *   conditions.
   * @throws {UnsupportedError} of kind `"build target"`, found `"NoTarget"`,
   *   when a class reader that does not read editor-only fields gets a file
   *   built for the editor (`BuildTarget.NoTarget`), such as a `Texture2D` or
   *   a `MonoScript`. `MonoBehaviour`'s header reader refuses one too, but
   *   `read()` reaches it only when the file has no type tree, and Unity
   *   always writes one into an editor file.
   * @throws {UnsupportedError} for a `Mesh` whose vertices or triangles cannot
   *   be decoded: a submesh of lines or points (kind `"mesh topology"`), a
   *   vertex format Unity does not define or bone data in the wrong kind of
   *   format (`"vertex format"`), more than four bones per vertex
   *   (`"bones per vertex"`)
   * @throws {UnsupportedError} of kind `"object without a type tree"`, naming
   *   the class id and path id, for a class without a hardcoded reader in a
   *   file built without type trees; and whatever else {@link readTypeTree}
   *   refuses
   * @throws {ResourceNotFoundError} when the data is in a resource file that
   *   was not passed to `load()`; always, for data in a resource file, when
   *   this reader was not built by `load()`
   * @throws {CorruptError} when the data does not hold together, for example:
   *   the object ends early, a count or length the reader checks is negative
   *   or runs past the object's end, a reader that reads the whole object
   *   finds bytes left after its last field, or the type tree read does not
   *   end exactly at `byteSize`; when a `Texture2D`'s `m_StreamData.offset` is
   *   2^53 or above, or the resource range runs past the end of its file; when
   *   a `Texture2D` of non-zero size has no image data, inline or in a resource file;
