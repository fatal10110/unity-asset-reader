# unity-asset-reader-node

Node.js adapter for [`unity-asset-reader`](https://github.com/fatal10110/unity-asset-reader/blob/main/packages/core/README.md).
It adds `loadPath()`, which reads a Unity file or a whole folder from disk and unpacks it. It
finds each file's `.resS` / `.resource` sidecars, loads a loose serialized file's external
dependencies from the same folder, and merges split files (`.split0`, `.split1`, ...).

`unity-asset-reader` itself takes bytes (`Uint8Array`) and works anywhere. Use this package only
when the files are on a local disk.

## Install

```bash
npm install unity-asset-reader unity-asset-reader-node
```

`unity-asset-reader` is a peer dependency, so your app has exactly one copy of the parser.

## Usage

```js
import { ClassID, classIdName } from "unity-asset-reader";
import { loadPath } from "unity-asset-reader-node";

// A folder: every file below it, recursively.
const env = loadPath("Build/StreamingAssets/bundles");
for (const obj of env.objects) {
  console.log(classIdName(obj.type), obj.pathId);
}

// Or one file, with its externals and sidecars from the same folder
// (here sharedassets0.assets.resS and sharedassets0.resource, when they exist).
const level = loadPath("Game_Data/sharedassets0.assets");
const textures = level.objects.filter((obj) => obj.type === ClassID.Texture2D);
```

`loadPath()` returns the same `Env` as `load()`, so everything in the
[`unity-asset-reader` README](https://github.com/fatal10110/unity-asset-reader/blob/main/packages/core/README.md)
applies: `env.files`, `env.objects`, `obj.read()`, `env.resolve()`. Add
[`unity-asset-reader-texture`](https://github.com/fatal10110/unity-asset-reader/blob/main/packages/texture/README.md)
for pixels.

## What `loadPath()` reads

- **A folder** is scanned recursively. Every regular file in it is loaded, whatever its name. A
  symbolic link to a file is read; a link to a folder is not followed.
- **A file** is loaded with its sidecars from the same folder: `<name>.resS` and
  `<stem>.resource`. For `sharedassets0.assets` those are `sharedassets0.assets.resS` and
  `sharedassets0.resource`. A loose serialized file also loads the files its `m_Externals`
  reference, along with their sidecars and split parts. This follows further external references,
  skipping names already loaded. External and sidecar names are matched ignoring case. Only
  neighboring files are considered, never subfolders; unrelated files are not read. Missing
  externals are skipped and pointers into them remain `fileNotLoaded`.
- **Split files** (`<name>.split0` ... `<name>.splitN`, as Unity writes large files for Android)
  are merged in memory into one input named `<name>`. A path to any one part loads the whole
  file. When the merged `<name>` already sits next to its parts, it is used and the parts are
  skipped. Nothing is written to disk.

Each file is passed to `load()` under its path relative to the folder you gave (for a file: its
own folder), with `/` as the separator on every platform, for example `bundles/main`. That is the
`path` a loose file gets in `env.files`.

All the files of one call share one container. If one folder holds two builds that both have, for
example, a `sharedassets0.assets.resS`, the first one (in name order) serves both. Load each
build with its own call to keep them apart.

`loadPath()` is synchronous, like `load()`: it reads with `readFileSync`.

## Errors

- Node.js's own file system error (`ENOENT`, `EACCES`, ...) when the path does not exist, or when
  any file or folder in the scan cannot be read. A dangling symbolic link counts too. The scan
  never skips what it cannot read.
- `Error` when the path is neither a file nor a folder (a socket, a device).
- `CorruptError` when the parts of a split file have a gap. The message names the file and the
  first missing part.
- Anything `load()` or `readSerializedFile()` throws: `UnsupportedError`, `CorruptError`.
  Loading a single loose serialized file now parses its metadata to find its externals, so
  invalid metadata fails during `loadPath()` rather than on the first access to `env.objects`.

## Not supported

- Looking up a bundle node's externals on disk. Automatic external lookup applies to loose
  serialized files; pass all dependency bundles to `load()` or pass their folder to `loadPath()`.
- Streaming, or reading a large `.resS` in pieces: every file is read into memory whole.
- Browsers. Use `unity-asset-reader`'s `load()` with the bytes of a `File` or `fetch` response.

## Requirements

Node.js 20.19+ or 22.12+ (`engines`: `^20.19.0 || >=22.12.0`), for both `import` and
`require`. `require()` needs a Node.js that can `require()` an ES module, because
`unity-asset-reader`'s LZMA dependency is published as ES modules only. CI tests on 20.19.0 and
22.12.0.
