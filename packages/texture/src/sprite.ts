 * Decode a Sprite to RGBA8, top row first, like {@link decodeTexture2D}:
 * upstream's `SpriteHelper.GetImage`.
 *
 * A sprite's pixels live in another object, so this takes the Sprite's reader
 * and the env that loaded it rather than `obj.read()`'s data: the texture is
 * found through pointers, with `env.resolve`. When the sprite points at a
 * `SpriteAtlas` that is loaded, its texture and rectangle are the atlas'
 * entry for the sprite's `m_RenderDataKey`; otherwise (no atlas, or the atlas'
 * file is not loaded) they are the sprite's own `m_RD`, as upstream does.
 *
 * The rectangle is cut out of the texture (`textureRect`, from its bottom-left
 * corner, widened to whole pixels), and a packer's flip or rotation
 * (`SpritePackingRotation`) is undone. With `tightMesh`, pixels outside the
 * sprite's mesh are cleared, as upstream fills its triangles into a mask with
 * ImageSharp.Drawing 1.0.0-beta15 without antialiasing: a pixel is inside a
 * triangle when at least half of it is, measured along eight rows per pixel,
 * with the vertices' y snapped to eighths. That fill is derived from
 * ImageSharp.Drawing's code and is under the Apache License 2.0 (this
 * package's `NOTICE` and `LICENSE-APACHE`).
 *
 * A sprite whose render data names an alpha texture (`alphaTexture`, the
 * Android "split alpha" of a format without alpha, such as ETC1) gets that
 * texture's red channel as its alpha, as UnityPy's `get_image` does: both
 * textures are decoded and merged whole, before the cut. AssetStudio ignores
 * the alpha texture and returns such a sprite opaque.
 *
 * A sprite of a variant atlas (`downscaleMultiplier` above 0 and not 1) is
 * cut from its texture resized first, as upstream does: to its size divided
 * by the multiplier, truncated, with ImageSharp 2.1.3's default bicubic
 * resampling, which this reproduces (only the sprite's pixels are
 * resampled; see `resize.ts` for how ImageSharp's own output varies by CPU).
 * With an alpha texture, the merged texture is what is resized. With
 * `tightMesh`, a Tight-packed one is masked after that, as upstream masks it.
 *
 * `Rotate90` is turned back the way upstream turns it (ImageSharp
 * `Rotate(270)`). That direction is not verified against Unity's packer: no
 * fixture editor's packer writes `Rotate90`, and UnityPy, which turns the
 * other way, mistranslates the same upstream call rather than checking it
 * independently (#34; verification tracked in #160).
 *
 * With `options.decodedTextures`, sequential calls reuse their shared atlas
 * (and its alpha texture). The caller owns the map and decides how long to
 * retain its decoded pixels.
 * Without it, every call decodes the texture again. The map holds textures
 * as decoded, never resized: a variant sprite is resampled from them on
 * each call.
 *
 * Unlike upstream, which hands back no image or an unmasked one, this throws
 * where the result would be wrong: see below. A sprite whose atlas is loaded
 * and has Unity 6000.6's layout, which holds the packed sprites' meshes
 * itself, is refused for now: `UnsupportedError` of kind `"Unity version"`.
 *
 * @param sprite a Sprite (`ClassID.Sprite`) from `env.objects`
 * @param env the env that loaded it, and the files its texture and atlas are in
 * @param options see {@link DecodeSpriteOptions}
 * @returns a new RGBA image, top row first
 * @throws {TypeError} when `sprite` is not a Sprite
 * @throws {Error} before `initTexture` has finished, or when `sprite` is not
 *   one of `env.objects`
 * @throws {ResourceNotFoundError} when the texture, its alpha texture, or the
 *   atlas it is in, is in a SerializedFile that is not loaded (its
 *   `fileName`), or a texture's data is in a `.resS` that is not
 * @throws {UnsupportedError} what `obj.read()` and `decodeTexture2D` throw,
 *   and: an alpha texture of another size than the texture (kind
 *   `"sprite alpha texture size"`), a packing rotation Unity does not define
 *   (kind `"sprite packing rotation"`) and, with `tightMesh`, a mesh whose
 *   positions are not 32-bit floats (kind `"sprite vertex format"`)
 * @throws {CorruptError} when the sprite's atlas does not hold its render
 *   data, a pointer is null or points at nothing or at the wrong class, the

 * Fill one triangle into `mask` (rows bottom first) as ImageSharp.Drawing
 * 1.0.0-beta15's `FillPathProcessor` fills a polygon without antialiasing,
 * which is what upstream's mask uses, so the mask agrees with upstream's to
 * the pixel (#34). Derived from its code (see above), in 32-bit floats as it
 * computes:
 *
 * - A triangle whose last corner is within 0.2 px of its first (on both axes),
 *   or whose corners are collinear (cross product within 0.003), is dropped.
 * - The corners' y is snapped to the nearest eighth (half away from zero), x
 *   is kept.
 * - Each pixel row is sampled on eight lines, at its y plus 0/8 to 7/8. On a
 *   line through the triangle, the span between its two edges adds, to each
 *   pixel it crosses, the part of the pixel's width it covers, divided by
 *   eight; the pixels at its two ends each add their own part, even when both
 *   ends are in one pixel (then that pixel adds `(1 + span) / 8`). A line
 *   through a lone top or bottom corner is a span of width 0.
 * - A pixel is filled when the sum reaches 0.5. Only the pixels of the
 *   triangle's bounding box, widened to whole pixels, are sampled.
