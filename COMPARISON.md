# Unity library comparison

Feature and format checklist based on the package documentation collected for the original
README comparison on **2026-09-29**. This is a documentation snapshot, not a compatibility test.

**✓** = documented support. **✗** = unsupported or not documented in the cited sources.
A ✗ does not prove that an undocumented feature is absent.

The **Our library** column covers this project as one library: `unity-asset-reader`,
`unity-asset-reader-texture`, `unity-asset-reader-node` and `texture2ddecoder-wasm`.
CLI features include those provided by its required AssetStudioMod application.

Our library exposes raw audio, video and font bytes; it does not decode audio or video.
Reading a Mesh through its type tree does not mean exporting a model.

## Texture formats

These rows compare documented decoding support, including decoders used internally.
Studio JS inherits the formats documented by unityfs-js.
