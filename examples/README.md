# Examples

Browser pages that use the reader packages together, and their tests. Nothing here is published
to npm.

- **[`cdn.html`](cdn.html)** is the smallest complete example: pick a bundle, list its objects,
  draw a Texture2D to a `<canvas>`. It needs no bundler and no install.
- **The GitHub Pages demo**, [`docs/index.html`](../docs/index.html), is a fuller page. Its test
  lives here too.

## Try it

`cdn.html` loads the packages from jsDelivr, so it needs nothing built. Serve it over HTTP with
any static server (opening the file as `file://` does not work), for example this repo's own:

```bash
npm ci                               # serve.mjs reads its package list from node_modules
node examples/serve.mjs              # then open http://127.0.0.1:8080/examples/cdn.html
```

Use that URL, not the `?local` link the server prints: `?local` needs the builds described
below.

To run the page on this repo's own builds instead of the published packages, see
[Where the packages come from](#where-the-packages-come-from).

## Files

| File | What |
|---|---|
| [`cdn.html`](cdn.html) | Pick a bundle, list its objects, draw a Texture2D to a `<canvas>`. No bundler, no install. |
| [`cdn-worker.js`](cdn-worker.js) | The Worker `cdn.html` runs the reader in. |
| [`serve.mjs`](serve.mjs) | Static server with a local stand-in for jsDelivr, for trying the page on this repo's builds. |
| [`tests/cdn.spec.mts`](tests/cdn.spec.mts) | The Playwright smoke test of `cdn.html` (plan §5). |
| [`tests/demo.spec.mts`](tests/demo.spec.mts) | The Playwright test of the GitHub Pages demo, [`docs/index.html`](../docs/index.html). |

## How `cdn.html` works

The page runs the reader in a module Worker. The parse path is synchronous (plan D4), so on the
main thread a big bundle would freeze the page.

The Worker imports the packages from jsDelivr, and sends the page plain data: the object list,
and RGBA pixels that go straight into `ImageData`. The page itself imports nothing.

- **No import map.** Import maps do not apply inside Workers. So the Worker imports jsDelivr's
  `/+esm` builds. These also rewrite the packages' own bare imports (`fflate`, `lzma1`,
  `unity-asset-reader`, `texture2ddecoder-wasm`) to CDN URLs.
- **No special headers.** Everything is single-threaded (D6), so the page works from any static
  host without COOP/COEP. It has to be served over HTTP, not opened as `file://`.
- **One exact version per package.** jsDelivr's `/+esm` build of
  `unity-asset-reader-texture@1.3.0` imports `unity-asset-reader@1.3.0/+esm` and
  `texture2ddecoder-wasm@1.2.6/+esm`: exact versions, not ranges.
  - The Worker imports core at that same version, so core is loaded once.
  - It takes the WASM from that same decoder release.
  - The versions are the constants at the top of `cdn-worker.js`, updated after each release
    (RELEASING.md).
- **The WASM** comes from `texture2ddecoder-wasm@1.2.6/wasm` on the same CDN. The decoder has
  its own version line, separate from the reader packages. `initTexture({ wasmPath })` loads
  it, even when the textures are plain formats decoded in TS.
- **`texture2ddecoder-wasm` 1.2.3 or later.** Earlier versions refuse to `initialize()` in a
  Worker ([#149](https://github.com/fatal10110/unity-asset-reader/issues/149)).

### Where the packages come from

`cdn-worker.js` holds the jsDelivr base URL and the versions. **Opening the page with `?local`
switches** it to the builds of this repo instead, served by `serve.mjs` under
`/npm/<name>/+esm`.

Without `?local` the page needs nothing built (see [Try it](#try-it)). With `?local`, build
everything first:

```bash
npm ci
npm run build                        # dist/ of every package
npm run build:wasm                   # needs Docker, see CONTRIBUTING.md
node examples/serve.mjs              # then open http://127.0.0.1:8080/
```

`http://127.0.0.1:8080/` opens `cdn.html?local`. What `serve.mjs` does:

- It sends no special headers.
- It maps `/npm/<name>/+esm` to the package's browser ESM entry in `node_modules`, and rewrites
  the bare imports of import statements the way jsDelivr does.
- The version in a URL is ignored, and the local build is served.
- It listens on `127.0.0.1` only.
- It serves only:
  - the packages the pages' Workers load, and their dependencies;
  - this folder;
  - `docs/` (the demo, at `/docs/?local`);
  - `fixtures/bundles/` (the demo's samples).

  Anything else under `node_modules` or the repo is a 404.

`scripts/tests/serve-examples.test.mjs` covers this.

## Smoke test

```bash
npm run test:smoke
```

This runs [`tests/cdn.spec.mts`](tests/cdn.spec.mts) in Chromium, against `cdn.html?local`. It
needs:

- the builds and the WASM above;
- a Playwright Chromium (`npx playwright install chromium`).

It checks that:

- The page is served without COOP/COEP, and is not cross-origin isolated.
- An LZ4 bundle with an RGBA32 texture in its `.resS` node is listed and drawn. Then an
  uncompressed bundle of block textures is loaded, and its DXT1 Crunch and DXT1 textures are
  drawn through the WASM.
- The pixels handed to the canvas match the UnityPy goldens in `fixtures/goldens.json`.
  `decodeTexture2D` returns the top row first, and the goldens hash Unity's bottom-up rows, so
  the test reverses the rows before it hashes. The DXT1 texture is also read back from the
  canvas.
- The reader modules load in the Worker only, never on the page: a Worker starts, and the
  page's own resource timeline has no `/npm/` module. That is the responsiveness proof (D4). The
  fixtures are too small for a timing check to tell a Worker from the main thread.
- The Worker loads exactly one `unity-asset-reader` module: its own import and the texture
  package's peer import are the same URL.

CI runs it in the `decoder` job, the only job that builds the WASM.

### After a release

Check the published packages on jsDelivr with the same test. It needs the network, not the
builds:

```bash
CDN_LIVE=1 npm run test:smoke        # cdn.html without ?local
```

If core is loaded twice, `CORE_VERSION` in `cdn-worker.js` is not the version the texture
package's `/+esm` build imports.

## The demo page test

`npm run test:smoke` also runs [`tests/demo.spec.mts`](tests/demo.spec.mts), against
`docs/index.html?local` (the GitHub Pages demo). Its Worker takes the packages from `serve.mjs`,
and its samples from `/fixtures/bundles/`.

It opens the samples and checks:

- the asset table, its filters and `env.get`;
- image previews and their `imageInfo`;
- a TextAsset's text;
- a MonoBehaviour's fields (64-bit values exact);
- raw audio, video and font bytes;
- "decode all images";
- an error message;
- that the Worker loads one copy of core.

Every expected value comes from `fixtures/goldens.json`.

`CDN_LIVE=1 npm run test:smoke` opens the demo without `?local`: packages from jsDelivr, samples
from jsDelivr's GitHub endpoint on `main`. The demo imports the `@1` lines and reads the exact
versions from the headers of jsDelivr's texture build, so it needs no edit after a release.
